These are groups used by the Carbon Language project, listed here for
central tracking.

We use a mix of:

-  Groups to assist contacting key contributors on appropriate systems:

   -  **GitHub teams**
   -  **Discord roles**

-  **Google groups**, usually as Google Drive ACLs. We generally won’t
   use these as contact lists, unless specifically mentioned. Please
   prefer other community forums.

All contributors

TODO: Update this information, it’s out of date.

   organization <https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/people>`__

   -  `GitHub team: Contributors with label
      access <https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/contributors-with-label-access>`__:

-  `Google
   group <https://groups.google.com/g/carbon-lang-contributors>`__:

Team-specific access
--------------------

Any team-specific access will typically be managed by a team owner or
admin, when somebody joins the respective team.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most purposes, the Core team should be contacted about conduct
issues.

   group <https://groups.google.com/g/carbon-lang-conduct-team>`__:
   Primarily a contact list.

Implementation team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This team is responsible for development of Carbon’s primary, reference
implementation and toolchain. It also oversees other related
implementation work within the Carbon project, from tooling of the
language spec to test suites. There may be some overlap with
`admins <#admins>`__ – any issue can be resolved by escalating to the
`Carbon leads <#carbon-leads>`__. Notably, this team is *not*
responsible for the *design* of the language itself, only for its
implementation.

   team <https://github.com/orgs/carbon-language/teams/implementation-team>`__
-  Discord role: implementation-team
