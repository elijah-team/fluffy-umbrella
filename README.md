ABOUT
------

Elijjah is a high-level language suitable for piecemeal replacement in Java
and C/C++ programs, as well as new projects.  It is meant to integrate into
your project without much hassle. 

It is free software intended for use on all systems, including GNU/Linux.

`fluffy-umbrella` is a silly name for the current incarnation, implemented in
Java.  

You will need JVM 17 and Maven or Gradle.

Much work is needed.

See [Language Overview](docs/language-overview.md) for more details on the language.

All of this is a work in progress and your support would be appreciated.
